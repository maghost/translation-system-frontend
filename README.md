# translation-system-frontend

> This application is being developed for learning purposes.

The main objective is to develop an application (back-end + front-end) to facilitate the maintenance and management of project translation files (i18n). I'm using the CodeIgniter (PHP) translation file model.

## Installation

Run commands:

- `cp .env.example .env`
- `nvm use`
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
